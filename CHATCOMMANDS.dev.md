## ✅ Cursor Chat Command Guide for ASVT Build

### 🧽 Scratchpad Protocol (Top of `SCRATCHPAD.dev.md`)

# 🧭 Cursor Operator Notes

- Cursor uses `SCRATCHPAD.dev.md` as its only source of truth.
- All build instructions are written in that file.
- Only give Cursor one task at a time.
- Confirm each step before allowing Cursor to continue.

```md

🔁 Finish step 1. Let me confirm before you continue.  
🔒 Don’t move on to the next feature until I give the go-ahead.  
⛔️ Stop if any errors occur, and ask for correction.

### 🟢 Opening Prompts — Start or Resume Work

* **“In the Scratchpad, it says to build \[feature] — start with that.”**
* **“Begin with implementing \[component] as outlined in the Scratchpad.”**
* **“Follow the folder structure and create `[file path]` with \[functionality].”**
* **“Use the schema in the Scratchpad to create the Supabase table for \[x].”**

### 🧠 Error Handling — Stay On Track

* **“This error is blocking progress — resolve it and continue based on the Scratchpad.”**
* **“You veered off. Reset and stick to what the Scratchpad specifies.”**
* **“Fix this issue, then return to building the feature described in the Scratchpad.”**

### 🧼 Refocusing — Clean Up AI Mistakes

* **“The Scratchpad didn’t mention that — remove it.”**
* **“That file wasn’t listed. Delete or rename it to match the Scratchpad.”**
* **“You’re using Prisma, but the Scratchpad clearly says to use Supabase.”**

### ⏪ Continuing Work — Sequential Progress

* **“Now do the next task in the Scratchpad list.”**
* **“Continue with the next core feature mentioned.”**
* **“What’s the next logical step in the Scratchpad?”**

### ✨ Optional Finishing Touch (to say once at start of session)

> “Use the Scratchpad as the source of truth. Work one task at a time. Ask for confirmation before continuing to the next. Stop on any error.”
